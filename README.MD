The Big Nerd Ranch Guide project This app documents "crimes" by tracking the event, the date/time, and a photo. Additionally, the event can be shared with others via email, Twitter, Facebook, etc. In building this app, I learned many topics: fragments, the fragment lifecycle, and app architecture incorporating fragments, dependencies, xml styles, themes and theme attributes, recycler views and associated adapter and view holder, ViewPagers and PagerAdapter, dialogs (DatePicker), the toolbar and menus, SQLite, implicit intents (sharing and photos), and the list-detail (or master-detail) interface.
